**Resiliant Git Hub Connector**
A standalone Python library, github_connector, that abstracts away the complexities of the GitHub API. The Standard: This is not a script. It is a library. It is robust, reusable, and bulletproof. If the network flickers or GitHub asks you to slow down, my library handles it gracefully without crashing the main application.
